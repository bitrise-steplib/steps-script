  The power is in your hands. Use it wisely!

  Specify the script content and (optionally) the script runner,
  to run any custom script in your [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io/) workflow!

  The **runner** can even be a command, as long as it's available in the `PATH`
  and can execute the script, it will work.

  For example to run a [Go](https://golang.org/) Hello World "script"
  you can define the content:

  ```
  package main
  import "fmt"
  func main() {
      fmt.Println("Hello World")
  }
  ```

  Set the *Execute with* parameter to `go run` and specify
  a *script file path* because `go run` can only accept (at the moment)
  files with a `.go` extension (just specify `main.go` or `step.go` as the script path).

  If the `go` binary can be found in the `$PATH` your Hello World
  script will run without any problem.

        The executor to be used for running the script.
        If it's available in the PATH you can just
        specify `ruby` or `python`, generally
        if you know the path of the executor you should
        define that, like `/bin/bash`.

        You can even specify an execution command
        like `go run` instead of just a binary.

      description: |
        Save the specified script content to this path
        before execution. The file will be removed after
        the script finishes.

        Generally you don't have to define this but
        there might be cases where the file's name or path
        actually matters.
        For example `go run` only accepts `.go` files.

        If you specify a relative path then it will be
        relative to the *working directory* (which you
        can optinally specify as well).
